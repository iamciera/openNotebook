# Machine_learning_approaches

# Logical Regression 

Classification of enhancer expression during embryogenesis. 

1. Dataset is used to predict parameters
2. Find desicion boundry based on hypothesis and parameters of hypothesis

Parameters of hypothesis


## Optimization Algorithms:

1.  Conjugate gradient
2.  BFGS
3.  L - BFGS
  

## Sequence Features

Transcription binding site
Co-binding conservation (?)

## Training Sets

1. Stage specific 
2. Enhancer signal negative or possibly brain if you can get this data
3. 

# Random Forest

Two classes are defined 1. Embryogenesis enhancer 2. negative enhancer.
