# Logical Regression 

Classification of enhancer expression during embryogenesis. 

1. Dataset is used to predict parameters
2. Find desicion boundry based on hypothesis and parameters of hypothesis

Parameters of hypothesis


## Optimization Algorithms:

1.  Conjugate gradient
2.  BFGS
3.  L - BFGS
  

## Sequence Features

Transcription binding site
Co-binding conservation (?)

## Training Sets

**On choosing the training set**: The training set can be selected by applying a random filter to the data, e.g., select 20% of the points at random to generate the model and test against the remaining 80%. If you want to be especially careful, then do this multiple times, i.e., select different random training sets and compare the models. If you get similar models then your model has probably captured the essential chemistry and physics of the problem. If the models are very different, then you are just fitting equations without a good physical basis.

Dividing Datasets: [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13610074/is-there-a-rule-of-thumb-for-how-to-divide-a-dataset-into-training-and-validatio)

1. Stage specific 
2. Enhancer signal negative or possibly brain if you can get this data
3. 

# Random Forest

Two classes are defined 1. Embryogenesis enhancer 2. negative enhancer.
