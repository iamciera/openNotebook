# Overview

## Main questions

1. What are the higher order TFBS aggregation patterns that correspond to enhancer expression patterning?
  * Number of TFs within each enhancer (quantified by how many times each unique TF is present)
  * Length between same and different types of TFs (homo-dimeric or hetero-dimeric)
  * overlapping motifs = competitive binding by steric hindrance

2. Are the constraints found conserved in Montium species?  How do the constraints converge between montium species?
  * Define orthologous TFBS within enhancers between species
